# Unix Server Automation with Python

A comprehensive collection of Python scripts for Unix server automation, demonstrating advanced Python concepts and real-world system administration tasks.

## Overview

This repository contains production-ready Python code for automating Unix server operations, including:

- SSH connectivity and command execution
- System monitoring and alerting
- Log analysis and pattern detection
- Server provisioning and configuration management
- Application deployment automation
- Multi-server workflow orchestration

## Features

### 1. Basic SSH Operations (`01_basic_ssh_connection.py`)
- Secure SSH connections with key-based authentication
- Command execution with timeout and retry logic
- File transfer capabilities (upload/download)
- Connection pooling and management
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Advanced SSH Operations (`02_advanced_ssh_operations.py`)
- Batch operations across multiple servers
- Parallel command execution
- Interactive shell sessions
- Port forwarding and tunneling
- SFTP operations with progress tracking

### 3. System Monitoring (`03_system_monitoring.py`)
- Real-time system metrics collection
- Automated alerting and notifications
- Log file analysis and pattern detection
- Health checking and diagnostics
- Performance monitoring and reporting
- Database storage for historical data
- Email notifications and report generation

### 4. Automation Scripts (`04_automation_scripts.py`)
- Task automation with rollback capabilities
- Server provisioning and configuration
- Application deployment with blue-green strategies
- Configuration management and drift detection
- Multi-server workflow orchestration
- Infrastructure as code principles

## Python Concepts Demonstrated

### Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes and inheritance
- Data classes and type hints
- Context managers (`__enter__`, `__exit__`)
- Property decorators and descriptors
- Abstract base classes

### Advanced Python Features
- Generators and iterators
- Decorators and metaclasses
- Async/await patterns
- Threading and multiprocessing
- Exception handling and custom exceptions

### Design Patterns
- Factory pattern for object creation
- Observer pattern for event handling
- Strategy pattern for algorithms
- Command pattern for task execution
- Singleton pattern for configuration

### Data Structures and Algorithms
- Collections (deque, defaultdict, Counter)
- Queue operations for task management
- Graph algorithms for dependency resolution
- Caching and memoization
- Data serialization (JSON, YAML, pickle)

### Networking and I/O
- Socket programming
- HTTP client operations
- File I/O and path manipulation
- Database operations (SQLite)
- Email automation (SMTP)
